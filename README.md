# Flower Classification with TensorFlow

Welcome to the **Flower Classification** project! 🌸 This repository contains a machine learning model built with TensorFlow to classify different types of flowers using image data.

## 📂 Project Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize and classify flower species from images. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled flower images and can predict the species of a flower given a new image.

## 🛠️ Features
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN model architecture with TensorFlow and Keras
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of training results
- Inference on new images

## 🚀 Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flower-classification.git
cd flower-classification
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install the required packages:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> You can generate the `requirements.txt` file with:
> ```bash
> pip freeze > requirements.txt
> ```

## 📘 Dataset
Make sure you have a flower dataset in the appropriate directory. If you’re using a public dataset, you can download and place it in a folder like `data/`.

## 🏃‍♀️ Usage

1. **Train the model:**
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open the `flower-classification-tensorflow.ipynb` file and run the cells to train the model.

2. **Test the model:**
Use the trained model to make predictions on new images by running the inference cells in the notebook.

3. **Visualize results:**
The notebook includes sections for visualizing accuracy, loss curves, and sample predictions.

## 📊 Results
The model achieves good accuracy on the validation set, and the predictions are visualized with corresponding class labels.
